                    <p class="about_us">Established in 2010 as we wanted to find a way to assist people with their renovations, using contractors that they could trust. Bradbury Home Consulting has a fun outlook and enjoys dealing with projects that range from unique, out of the box to traditional.
                            We provide quotes for all items of a renovation or new build. We save you time and the hassle of shopping around for quotes, by doing all the hard work for you.  We will assist in finding the right quote, from the right contractor.  
                            Our contractors include a wide range of Kwa Zulu Natalâ€™s established; owner run companies.  We carefully select all our contractors and work with them on a daily basis.  
                            We also offer project management which I personally oversee.  Ideal for people who do not live in Durban and wish to renovate their holiday home without the hassle of having to oversee the project.  
                            With an experienced team of contractors, we are able to handle your projects from design stage through to final completion. 
                            We enjoy building relationships with our clients and keep them updated throughout the process with clear communication. We pride ourselves on our exceptional service and expect our clients to have a happy feeling when they work with us.</p>
