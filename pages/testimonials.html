                <p>This is to confirm Kim from Bradbury Home Consulting , did renovations to my apartment
                  and I am very happy with the way it all turned out.
                Kim has an amazing and trustworthly team who have done a great job.
              I am based in JHB so was never able to be there, so it was all left in Kim's
              capable hands. I would definitely recommend Bradubury Home Consultants to everyone. <br>
            Thank you very much Kim.... I loved what you did to my place.</p>

            <p>I cannot give a bigger thank you to kim and her team for their remarkable service. <br>
              I purchased an apartment in Umhlanga 2017 and then started the daughting task
              of finding someone to project manage the renovation as I live in Joburg. <br>
              The entire apartment was gutted and everything was redone, bathrooms, kitchen
              walls taken down, ect...<br> I thought I was crazy to do this but thankgoodness <br>
              someone recommended Kim to me and I am ever so grateful As soon as I met her <br>
              I just felt she was the right woman for the job. <br>
              The complete renovation and final product is an absolute dream.
              All her contractors she used where phenomenal and not one of them let us down.<br>
              Thank you Kim for turning my apartment into a little piece of heaven.
